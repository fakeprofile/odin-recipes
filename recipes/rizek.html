    <ol>
        <li>
Cut the meat into slices. Then salt and pepper it on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
        We will prepare 3 deep plates. Pour plain flour into the first, beat two unboiled eggs without the shell into the second, add milk, a pinch of salt, a little pepper and mix well. Pour breadcrumbs into the third plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap the meat thoroughly on both sides in the first plate, then in the second and finally in the third
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour a sufficient amount of oil into the pan, heat it up and fry the cutlets.
        </li>

    </ol>

        Note by the author of the recipe:</p>
        <o>We can easily prepare breadcrumbs at home. Put the old hard rolls (but not the moldy ones) into a blender and blend them into a powder. This can be done by hand on a hand grater.</p>
