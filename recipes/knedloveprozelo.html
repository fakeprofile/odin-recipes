    <h4 class="stp">steps:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 170Â°C. Dice the onion.
        </li>
        <li>
        Salt and pepper the neck of the neck, sprinkle with cumin and rub it thoroughly with garlic on all sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the meat in a roasting pan on top of the onion cubes, add lard, cover with a cup of hot water and bake until soft for about 1 and a half hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cabbage: pour the vinegar into a mug and chop the cabbage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry the bacon, onion and cumin in the heated lard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the cabbage, cover with vinegar and bring to a boil. Then add salt, 3 spoons of sugar and, if the cabbage is slightly acidic, then 2 spoons of vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the baked meat from the oven and let it rest for fifteen to twenty minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After about 15 minutes of stewing, dust the cabbage with coarse flour, stirring constantly, and cook again on a low flame for about fifteen minutes. Or make a dough from the flour and thicken the cabbage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the baking pan in which you baked the meat on the stove and heat it up.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the baked juice with onion pieces to evaporate slightly, then pour in the flour and fry it a little.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in 200 ml of water (or as needed) and cook for about fifteen minutes
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with dumpling.
